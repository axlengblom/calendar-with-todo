A React.js project built for a school project.

Create a todo by selecting a date for the todo to be created. If you only want to view the todos for that date you can press the cancel button or the backdrop. 

All todos will show upp to the right of the calendar and the todos for the current day will show up below the calendar.

On the dates of the calendar the amount of todos will be seen under the date.

Todos can be marked as completed which will not remove them. They can also be deleted which will completley remove the todo.

The calendar was created with react-calendar npm package.
